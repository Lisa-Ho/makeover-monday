# MakeoverMonday Learning Project

[MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a data viz challenge aimed at the Tableau community. Every week, a new chart is shared including its underlying data set. Data viz pracitioners are then tasked to think about what works and what could be improved in the original. And then come up with a better solution using the Tableau dashboard software. 

I decided to use this challenge as a way to improve my data viz skills using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), a plotting library for python, and [D3](https://d3js.org/), a plotting libary based on javascript. It means that I don't have to come up with new project ideas for myself all the time as well as source suitable data sets and clean them. 

This weekly challenges makes it a more contained task that is easier to finish, so that I can focus more on picking up some new technical skills in the different charting library. 

So when looking through my creations, don't expect any amazing solutions just yet.
